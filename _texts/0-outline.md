## Rules of Civil Procedure

- (a) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP” or “The Rules”)
- (b) The U.S. Constitution
- (c) United States Treaties

## Basic Jurisdictional Concepts

- (a)	Jurisdiction is what gives a court the power to act.
- (b)	Courts must have both subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.
- (c)	If there is no jurisdiction, the court has no power to act on the dispute at han(d)

## Subject Matter Jurisdiction

- (a)	Subject Matter Jurisdiction is the court’s power over a specific dispute, as contrasted to Personal Jurisdiction which relates to the court’s power over an individual.
- {:.indent-3}(i)	SMJ has to do with whether the case can be in state or federal court
- (b) Subject Matter Jurisdiction in Federal Courts
- {:.indent-3}(i) Requirements:
- {:.indent-4}(1)	Federal Question [(28 USC 1331)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1331)
- {:.indent-5}(a)	A claim arising under federal statute, U.S. Constitution, or U.S. treaties.
- {:.indent-5}(b)	Other exceptions (like if the US is a party, or specialty courts like Bankruptcy)
- {:.indent-4}(2)	Diversity Jurisdiction [(28 USC 1332)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332)
- {:.indent-5}(a)	Complete diversity of citizenship among all parties
- {:.indent-6}(i)	“Citizenship”
- {:.indent-7}(1)	For persons = residence
- {:.indent-7}(2)	For corporations = place of primary business OR where it is incorporated
- {:.indent-6}(ii)	“Among all parties”
- {:.indent-7}(1)	No plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant.
- {:.indent-5}(b)	AND! Amount in Controversy exceeds $75K
- {:.indent-4}(3)	Supplemental Jurisdiction [(28 USC 1367)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1367)
- {:.indent-5}(a)	When federal court has jurisdiction over some claims, it can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state claims if they arise from the same case or controversy
- {:.indent-6}(i)	Same case or controversy = “common nucleus of operative fact”
- {:.indent-6}(ii)	In other words, the same transaction or occurrence

## Erie Doctrine

- (a)	Relates to which law is applied by the federal court sitting in DIVERSITY JX
- (b)	Allows fed ct. to apply its own procedural laws but requires court to apply state substantive law (this is the VERTICAL choice of law - between fed and state cts)
- (c)	So, what state law is considered procedural and what is considered substantive? Here are some high frequency examples of each:
- {:.indent-3}(i)	Procedural laws
- {:.indent-4}(1)	Civil procedure rules
- {:.indent-4}(2)	Burden of proof standards
- {:.indent-3}(ii)	Substantive laws
- {:.indent-4}(1) Claims based in state law
- {:.indent-4}(2)	Damages
- {:.indent-4}(3)	Statute of frauds
- {:.indent-4}(4)	Choice of law rules
- {:.indent-5}(a)	A fed ct. sitting in DivJx must apply the forum state’s choice of law rules to determine which state’s substantive law applies to the action (this isn’t Erie specific, Choice of Law doctrine generally dictates HORIZONTAL choice of law - between different states)
- {:.indent-3}(iii)	What about statute of limitations? It depends.
- {:.indent-4}(1)	Where a substantive right is conditioned upon SOL -> substantive
- {:.indent-4}(2)	Where a substantive right is not conditioned upon SOL -> procedural
- (d)	Once applicable state law is determined, the fed ct. must apply the law as the forum state court would        
- {:.indent-3}(i)	It cannot make its own independent judgment on the construction of the law
- {:.indent-3}(ii)	When no controlling state case law is available to provide federal court with guidance, the federal court must predict how the state’s highest court would rule on the issue. (sometimes called the “Erie educated guess” principle)
