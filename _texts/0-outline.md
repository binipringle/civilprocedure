## I. Rules of Civil Procedure

- {:.indent-3}a. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP” or “The Rules”)
- {:.indent-3}b. The U.S. Constitution
- {:.indent-3}c. United States Treaties

## II. Basic Jurisdictional Concepts

- {:.indent-3}a.	Jurisdiction is what gives a court the power to act.
- {:.indent-3}b.	Courts must have both subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.
- {:.indent-3}c.	If there is no jurisdiction, the court has no power to act on the dispute at hand.

## III. Subject Matter Jurisdiction

a. Subject Matter Jurisdiction (SMJx) is the court’s power over a specific dispute, as contrasted to Personal Jurisdiction (PJx) which relates to the court’s power over an individual. SMJx has to do with whether the case can be in state or federal court.

- {:.indent-3}i. **Subject Matter Jurisdiction in Federal Courts**
- {:.indent-3}A federal court has SMJx if the claim meets at least one of the following requirements:

- {:.indent-5}1 . **Federal Question** (28 USC § 1331 [^1])
- {:.indent-6}a.	A claim arising under federal statute, U.S. Constitution, or U.S. treaties.
- {:.indent-6}b.	Other exceptions (like if the US is a party, or specialty courts like Bankruptcy)

- {:.indent-5}2 .	**Diversity Jurisdiction (DivJx)** (28 USC § 1332 [^2])
- {:.indent-6}a.	There must be complete diversity of citizenship among all parties
- {:.indent-7}i.	“Citizenship”
- {:.indent-8}1 .	For persons = residence
- {:.indent-8}2 .	For corporations = place of primary business **OR** where it is incorporated
- {:.indent-7}ii.	“Among all parties”
- {:.indent-8}1 .	No plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant.
- {:.indent-6}b.	**AND** the amount in Controversy must exceed $75K

- {:.indent-5}3 .	**Supplemental Jurisdiction (SuppJx)** (28 USC § 1367 [^3])
- {:.indent-6}a.	When federal court has jurisdiction over some claims, it can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state claims if they arise from the same case or controversy
- {:.indent-7}i.	Same case or controversy = “common nucleus of operative fact”
- {:.indent-7}ii.	In other words, the same transaction or occurrence

[^1]: 28 U.S. Code § 1331 states that "The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is openly accessible at [Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1331)

[^2]: 28 U.S.C. § 1332 is openly accessible at [Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332)

[^3]: 28 U.S.C. § 1367 is openly accessible at [Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1367)

## IV. Erie Doctrine

a. The Erie Doctrine relates to which law is applied by the federal court **sitting in Diversity Jurisdiction.** The Erie Doctrine allows the federal court to apply its own procedural laws but requires the court to apply state substantive law. [^4] A federal court cannot apply state procedural laws. The following are some high frequency examples of procedural and substantive laws:

- {:.indent-3}i.	**Procedural laws**
- {:.indent-4}1 .	Civil procedure rules
- {:.indent-4}2 .	Burden of proof standards

- {:.indent-3}ii.	**Substantive laws**
- {:.indent-4}1 . Claims based in state law
- {:.indent-4}2 .	Damages
- {:.indent-4}3 .	Statute of frauds
- {:.indent-4}4 .	Choice of law rules
- {:.indent-5}a. A federal court sitting in DivJx must apply the forum state’s choice of law rules to determine which state’s substantive law applies to the action. (this isn’t Erie specific, Choice of Law doctrine generally dictates HORIZONTAL choice of law - between different states)

- {:.indent-3}iii.	**Statute of limitations** (SOL) can be procedural or substantive.
- {:.indent-4}1 .	Where a substantive right is conditioned upon SOL -> substantive
- {:.indent-4}2 .	Where a substantive right is not conditioned upon SOL -> procedural


d.	Once applicable state law is determined, the federal court must apply the law as the forum state court would        
- {:.indent-3}i.	The federal court cannot make its own independent judgment on the construction of the law
- {:.indent-3}ii.	When no controlling state case law is available to provide federal court with guidance, the federal court must predict how the state’s highest court would rule on the issue. (sometimes called the “Erie educated guess” principle)

[^4]: Some state laws are considered procedural and others are considered substantive. [A federal court can only apply substantive state law, not procedural. When a federal court applies state law, this application is the **vertical** choice of law (between federal and state courts) as opposed to the **horizontal** choice of law (between state courts of different states). This isn't Erie-specific; it's called the Choice of Law doctrine.

## V. Personal Jurisdiction

a.	Vocabulary from **Pennoyer v. Neff** (this case will not be on the bar exam)

- {:.indent-3}i.	**Consent**: defendant consents to jurisdiction in a specific forum.
- {:.indent-3}ii.	**In personam**: defendant is served in hand within the forum state.
- {:.indent-3}iii.	**In rem**: defendant has property in forum state, and the litigation is about that property.
- {:.indent-3}iv.	**Quasi in rem**: defendant has property in the forum state **but** litigation is not about that property **and** court only has Jx up to the value of defendant’s property in the forum state.

b.	**Current Rule that Matters**

A federal court has personal jurisdiction based on either of two categories: (i) the **Traditional Basis of jurisdiction** or (ii) **Long-Arm Jurisdiction**.

- {:.indent-3}i.	**Traditional Basis of Personal Jurisdiction** (over defendant)
- {:.indent-4}1 .	Domicile (where defendant resides); or
- {:.indent-4}2 .	Presence in the state when served; or
- {:.indent-4}3 .	Consent (defendant consents to jurisdiction in a specific forum); or
- {:.indent-4}4 .	Waiver (by not objecting defendant waives right to object).
- {:.indent-4}5 .	**Any of these** must meet the constitutional requirement of due process.

- {:.indent-3}ii.	**Long-Arm Jurisdiction**
- {:.indent-4}1 .	Applies when defendant is not a resident of the forum state; **and**
- {:.indent-4}2 .	the forum state must have a long-arm statute; **and**
- {:.indent-4}3 .[the claim] must meet the constitutional requirement for due process.*

- {:.indent-5}a. **Two Prongs**. The constitutional requirement for due process has two prongs. These are (1) minimum contacts and (2) fair play and substantial justice. To satisfy the constitutional requirement for due process, both prongs must be satisfied.  

- {:.indent-6}1 . The **first prong** is **minimum contacts** (“contacts and relatedness”). Sufficient minimum contacts exist when there is either general jurisdiction or specific jurisdiction.

- {:.indent-7}a.	**General jurisdiction**
- {:.indent-8}i.	Exists when the defendant’s contacts with the forum state are so substantial and of such a nature that the defendant is essentially at home in the state.
- {:.indent-8}ii.	Claim does not need to relate to or arise from the defendant’s contacts with the forum state.
- {:.indent-8}iii.	Defendant must be a citizen of the forum state for general jurisdiction to apply.
- {:.indent-8}1 .	If the defendant is a natural person, they must be domiciled in the forum state.
- {:.indent-8}2 .	If the defendant is a corporation, it must be “at home” in forum state

- {:.indent-7}b.	**Specific jurisdiction**
- {:.indent-8}i.	Exists when the suit arises out of or relates to the defendant’s contacts with the forum state.
- {:.indent-8}ii.	There must be a connection between the forum state and the underlying controversy.
- {:.indent-9}1 .	Regularly occurring sales of a product in a state does not justify the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim unrelated to those sales.

- {:.indent-6}2 . The **second prong** is **fair play and substantial justice (“fairness”)**.
- {:.indent-7}a. Even if the minimum contacts test is met, it must be fair and reasonable for the defendant to be sued in the forum state, "so as not to offend notions of fair play and substantial justice.”
- {:.indent-7}b. The burden is on the defendant to show that it would be unreasonable to defend themselves in the forum state that it would constitute a violation of Due Process.
- {:.indent-8}i. When calculating burden on defendant, a court will consider
- {:.indent-9}1 . the burden on the defendant of litigating in the forum state; and
- {:.indent-9}2 . the state’s interest in providing a forum; and
- {:.indent-9}3 . the plaintiff’s interest in a convenient forum; and - {:.indent-9}4 . the interest of the judicial system to efficiently resolve disputes.

## Removal

a.	Defendant has a right to remove case from state to federal court (vertical movement) within the forum state where the claim was filed if:
i.	The federal court has (or would have) SMJx over the matter
ii.	No defendant is a resident of the forum state
-AND-
iii.	All defendants agree to removal
b.	Procedure = Def. files a Notice of Removal in District Court (See 28 USC § 1446(a)), then serves notice upon all parties and with the state court. Removal is automatic; state court takes no further action.
c.	A plaintiff CANNOT remove a case to federal court. This right only resides with Defendant.

II.	VENUE (FYI: the most consistently tested rules of Civ Pro on bar exam, only after SMJx + PJx)
a.	Key concept: venue and forum are different in that venue refers to the specific district, whereas forum refers to the entire state. (i.e. New York is forum; SDNY is venue)
b.	Venue is proper in any district where:
i.	Any Defendant resides, so long as all Def’s are resident of forum state
1.	How is residence determined for venue?
a.	Domicile = residence AND subjective intent to stay permanently
b.	For corporation/business/organization, Residence = any district where Def is subject to PJX
ii.	Where substantial portion of claim occurred
iii.	Where property connected to the action is located
iv.	If none above apply (rare), venue is proper In any judicial district where Def is subject to PJx
(this is why you always do the PJx analysis first! The PJx analysis often feeds directly into venue analysis)
c.	TRANSFER OF VENUE (horizontal movement) (must do this analysis EVEN IF you find venue is proper)
i.	If venue is improper, the court MUST either:
1.	Dismiss -OR-
2.	Transfer to the proper venue if the interest of justice requires it*
ii.	Even if venue is proper, the court MAY use its discretion to transfer venue if:
1.	it is needed for the convenience of the parties + convenience of witnesses
-AND- if the interest of justice requires it*
-AND- the action could have been brought in the receiving court  
2.	OR… DISMISS! When the more appropriate forum is not a U.S. District Court (aka Forum Non Conveniens)
a.	Courts will apply balancing test between private and public interests
i.	Private = access to evidence & witnesses, connection of Pl.’s claim to forum, etc.
ii.	Public = good use of court’s finite resources? multiple sets of laws may confuse jury, local interest in having case heard at home, etc.
iii.	Not taken into consideration = which forum has more favorable laws for Pl.’s claim

III.	SERVICE OF PROCESS AND NOTICE
a.	Important: Insufficient or defective service of process can result in technical dismissal!  
b.	Terms that no one ever explains:
i.	Service simply refers to the delivery of the required documents
ii.	Process is another name for the summons
iii.	Notice is what you are trying to accomplish (notifying the Defendant of action)
c.	Must have Summons and Complaint
i.	Summons notifies the Def. of required details facilitating their right to be heard, including:
1.	Name the court and the parties
2.	State the name of plaintiff’s attorney (if there is one)
3.	State date and time within which def. must appear and/or defend
4.	Notify the def. that failure to appear or answer will result in a default judgment!
5.	(For a list of required items, see FRCP 4(a)… FRCP! Wheeeeeeee!!!!)
ii.	Complaint is the instrument by which a lawsuit is filed (hint: it’s a copy of the lawsuit)
d.	Service must be made by person at least 18 years old AND not a party to the action.
e.	Method of service must be consistent with the constitutional requirements of Due Process Clause**  
i.	Serving an individual
1.	To the individual personally
2.	To someone of suitable age + discretion at individual’s current dwelling
3.	To an authorized agent
ii.	Serving a corporation, partnership or association
1.	In accordance with state law of forum state + state where service occurs
2.	Delivery to an officer or agent of the corporation
a.	Officer = person in executive role
b.	Agent = managing or authorized agent
iii.	Serving a foreign defendant
1.	By internationally agreed to means
-OR-
2.	If an international agreement exists -AND- it satisfies constitutional requirements of due process**
iv.	More rules for how to serve specific types of parties are found in FRCP 4(g)-(j)
FRCP! Wheeeeeeee!!!!
f.	And another thing: the FRCP actually incentivizes parties to accept service and waive their right to object by giving them a longer window to respond.


**When analyzing whether the “constitutional requirements of due process” are met service of process hypo, a helpful question to answer is: Was the service of process “reasonably calculated” to notify the defendant of the action and give them an opportunity to object?
