## I. Rules of Civil Procedure

- {:.indent-3}a. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP” or “The Rules”)
- {:.indent-3}b. The U.S. Constitution
- {:.indent-3}c. United States Treaties

## II. Basic Jurisdictional Concepts

- {:.indent-3}a.	Jurisdiction is what gives a court the power to act.
- {:.indent-3}b.	Courts must have both subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.
- {:.indent-3}c.	If there is no jurisdiction, the court has no power to act on the dispute at hand.

## III. Subject Matter Jurisdiction

a. Subject Matter Jurisdiction (SMJx) is the court’s power over a specific dispute, as contrasted to Personal Jurisdiction (PJx) which relates to the court’s power over an individual. SMJx has to do with whether the case can be in state or federal court.

- {:.indent-3}i. **Subject Matter Jurisdiction in Federal Courts**
- {:.indent-3}A federal court has SMJx if the claim meets at least one of the following requirements:

- {:.indent-5}1 . **Federal Question** (28 USC § 1331 [^1])
- {:.indent-6}a.	A claim arising under federal statute, U.S. Constitution, or U.S. treaties.
- {:.indent-6}b.	Other exceptions (like if the US is a party, or specialty courts like Bankruptcy)

- {:.indent-5}2 .	**Diversity Jurisdiction (DivJx)** (28 USC § 1332 [^2])
- {:.indent-6}a.	There must be complete diversity of citizenship among all parties
- {:.indent-7}i.	“Citizenship”
- {:.indent-8}1 .	For persons = residence
- {:.indent-8}2 .	For corporations = place of primary business **OR** where it is incorporated
- {:.indent-7}ii.	“Among all parties”
- {:.indent-8}1 .	No plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant.
- {:.indent-6}b.	**AND** the amount in Controversy must exceed $75K

- {:.indent-5}3 .	**Supplemental Jurisdiction (SuppJx)** (28 USC § 1367 [^3])
- {:.indent-6}a.	When federal court has jurisdiction over some claims, it can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state claims if they arise from the same case or controversy
- {:.indent-7}i.	Same case or controversy = “common nucleus of operative fact”
- {:.indent-7}ii.	In other words, the same transaction or occurrence

[^1]: The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

[^2]: 28 U.S.C. § 1332 is openly accessible at [(Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332)

[^3]: 28 U.S.C. § 1367 is openly accessible at [(Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1367)

## IV. Erie Doctrine

a. The Erie Doctrine relates to which law is applied by the federal court **sitting in Diversity Jurisdiction.** The Erie Doctrine allows the federal court to apply its own procedural laws but requires the court to apply state substantive law. [^4] A federal court cannot apply state procedural laws. The following are some high frequency examples of procedural and substantive laws:

- {:.indent-3}i.	**Procedural laws**
- {:.indent-4}1 .	Civil procedure rules
- {:.indent-4}2 .	Burden of proof standards

- {:.indent-3}ii.	**Substantive laws**
- {:.indent-4}1 . Claims based in state law
- {:.indent-4}2 .	Damages
- {:.indent-4}3 .	Statute of frauds
- {:.indent-4}4 .	Choice of law rules
- {:.indent-5}a. A federal court sitting in DivJx must apply the forum state’s choice of law rules to determine which state’s substantive law applies to the action. (this isn’t Erie specific, Choice of Law doctrine generally dictates HORIZONTAL choice of law - between different states)

- {:.indent-3}iii.	**Statute of limitations** (SOL) can be procedural or substantive.
- {:.indent-4}1 .	Where a substantive right is conditioned upon SOL -> substantive
- {:.indent-4}2 .	Where a substantive right is not conditioned upon SOL -> procedural


d.	Once applicable state law is determined, the federal court must apply the law as the forum state court would        
- {:.indent-3}i.	The federal court cannot make its own independent judgment on the construction of the law
- {:.indent-3}ii.	When no controlling state case law is available to provide federal court with guidance, the federal court must predict how the state’s highest court would rule on the issue. (sometimes called the “Erie educated guess” principle)

[^4]: Some state laws are considered procedural and others are considered substantive. [A federal court can only apply substantive state law, not procedural. When a federal court applies state law, this application is the **vertical** choice of law (between federal and state courts) as opposed to the **horizontal** choice of law (between state courts of different states). This isn't Erie-specific; it's called the Choice of Law doctrine.

## V. Personal Jurisdiction

a.	**Pennoyer v. Neff** (will not be on bar exam)

- {:.indent-3}i.	**Consent**: defendant consents to jurisdiction in a specific forum.
- {:.indent-3}ii.	**In personam**: defendant is served in hand within the forum state.
- {:.indent-3}iii.	**In rem**: defendant has property in forum state, and the litigation is about that property.
- {:.indent-3}iv.	**Quasi in rem**: defendant has property in the forum state **but** litigation is not about that property **and** court only has Jx up to the value of defendant’s property in the forum state.

b.	**Current Rule that Matters**

A federal court has personal jurisdiction based on either of two categories: (i) the **Traditional Basis of jurisdiction** or (ii) **Long-Arm Jurisdiction**.

- {:.indent-3}i.	**Traditional Basis of Personal Jurisdiction** (over defendant)
- {:.indent-4}1 .	Domicile (where defendant resides); or
- {:.indent-4}2 .	Presence in the state when served; or
- {:.indent-4}3 .	Consent (defendant consents to jurisdiction in a specific forum); or
- {:.indent-4}4 .	Waiver (by not objecting defendant waives right to object).
- {:.indent-4}5 .	**Any of these** must meet the constitutional requirement of due process.

- {:.indent-3}ii.	**Long-Arm Jurisdiction**
- {:.indent-4}1 .	Applies when defendant is not a resident of the forum state; **and**
- {:.indent-4}2 .	the forum state must have a long-arm statute; **and**
- {:.indent-4}3 .[the claim] must meet the constitutional requirement for due process.*

- {:.indent-5}a. **Two Prongs**. The constitutional requirement for due process has two prongs. These are (1) minimum contacts and (2) fair play and substantial justice. To satisfy the constitutional requirement for due process, both prongs must be satisfied.  

- {:.indent-6}1 . The **first prong** is **minimum contacts** (“contacts and relatedness”). Sufficient minimum contacts exist when there is either general jurisdiction or specific jurisdiction.

- {:.indent-7}a.	**General jurisdiction**
- {:.indent-8}i.	Exists when the defendant’s contacts with the forum state are so substantial and of such a nature that the defendant is essentially at home in the state.
- {:.indent-8}ii.	Claim does not need to relate to or arise from the defendant’s contacts with the forum state.
- {:.indent-8}iii.	Defendant must be a citizen of the forum state for general jurisdiction to apply.
- {:.indent-8}1 .	If the defendant is a natural person, they must be domiciled in the forum state.
- {:.indent-8}2 .	If the defendant is a corporation, it must be “at home” in forum state

- {:.indent-7}b.	**Specific jurisdiction**
- {:.indent-8}i.	Exists when the suit arises out of or relates to the defendant’s contacts with the forum state.
- {:.indent-8}ii.	There must be a connection between the forum state and the underlying controversy.
- {:.indent-9}1 .	Regularly occurring sales of a product in a state does not justify the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim unrelated to those sales.

- {:.indent-6}2 . The **second prong** is **fair play and substantial justice (“fairness”)**.
- {:.indent-7}a. Even if the minimum contacts test is met, it must be fair and reasonable for the defendant to be sued in the forum state, "so as not to offend notions of fair play and substantial justice.”
- {:.indent-7}b. The burden is on the defendant to show that it would be unreasonable to defend themselves in the forum state that it would constitute a violation of Due Process.
- {:.indent-8}i. When calculating burden on defendant, a court will consider
- {:.indent-9}1 . the burden on the defendant of litigating in the forum state; and
- {:.indent-9}2 . the state’s interest in providing a forum; and
- {:.indent-9}3 . the plaintiff’s interest in a convenient forum; and - {:.indent-9}4 . the interest of the judicial system to efficiently resolve disputes.
