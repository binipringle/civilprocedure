## Subject Matter Jurisdiction

Subject-matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear a specific kind of claim. Federal courts have limited subject matter jurisdiction. They have subject matter jurisdiction if (1) the case is a federal question; or (2) there is complete diversity of citizenship between adverse parties and the amount in controversy is more than $75,000.

## Federal Question

Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over a case if the cause of action states that there has been a violation of federal law. The alleged violation of federal law has to be the reason why the case is being brought; it cannot be an additional charge if that charge does not go to the heart of the alleged offense.

**Federal common law** is generally confined to (1) maritime law; (2) foreign relations; (3) commercial rights and liabilities of the federal government; and (4) property rights and liabilities of the federal government. In these cases, federal courts will apply (and, if need be, create) federal common law and ignore any state law that might otherwise apply.[^1]

[^1]:EXAMPLE: The U.S. Treasury issued a check that was stolen and fraudulently cashed at a bank. The bank has asked the federal government to pay it the funds that it paid out to the fraudster. If the check was issued by a private individual, state law would control the check writer’s obligation and require the check writer to pay the funds. Because this case concerns the commercial rights and obligation of the federal government, however, the federal courts have the power to craft federal common law that will preempt any contrary state law. The federal courts may craft a rule that relieves the federal government of any obligation to pay on the check.

## Diversity Jurisdiction

Federal courts can have subject matter jurisdiction if there is (a) complete diversity of citizenship between adverse parties and (b) the amount in controversy is more than $75,000. Complete diversity of citizenship is when all the adverse parties are citizens of different states.

A **person** is a citizen of a state where they have their domicile. A domicile is the place where a person lives and intends to continue living in the foreseeable future. Factors that contribute to showing that a state is a person’s domicile include whether that person resides in the state, owns property in the state, is licensed in the state, participates in political processes in the state (i.e., voting), pays taxes in the state, and is involved in community activities in the states.

A **corporation** is domiciled (1) where it was incorporated, and (2) where its principal place of business is located (where principal officers control corporate activities or the corporation has its “nerve center”).

The second requirement for a federal court to have diversity jurisdiction is that **the amount in controversy be more than $75,000**. A court will defer to the plaintiff’s allegation of financial injury unless it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's allegation is incorrect.

The court **will aggregate claims** if the plaintiff brings multiple claims against a **single defendant**. The claims can be totally unrelated; there is no same transaction or occurrence. The court **will not aggregate claims** against **multiple defendants**.

## Supplemental Jurisdiction

28 U.S.C. 1367(a) provides that where federal district courts have subject matter jurisdiction in any civil action, they also have **supplemental jurisdiction** over other claims so related to the original claim that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the Constitution. Supplemental jurisdiction includes claims asserted by the original plaintiff against the original defendant, but also by the defendant against the plaintiff or other parties, or by plaintiffs against such parties, or by defendants against one another, and so on. See 28 U.S.C. 1367(a) (affirming that supplemental jurisdiction covers matters involving the joinder of additional parties).

The test for “same case or controversy” is if a claim for which there is no independent basis for federal jurisdiction has a **common  nucleus of operative fact** with a claim that does have an independent basis for federal jurisdiction. For there to be a common nucleus of operative fact there must be a logical relationship between the claims. The two claims do not need to have exactly the same facts, but they should be “so logically connected that considerations of judicial economy and fairness dictate that all issues be resolved in one lawsuit.” *Jones v. Ford Motor Credit Co.*, 358 F.3d 205, 209-211 (2d. Cir. 2004).

*Watch out for sneaky plaintiffs in diversity jurisdiction trying to sneak claims which would not normally be allowed in diversity jurisdiction:*

28 U.S.C. 1367(b) places a **limitation on supplemental jurisdiction** where the sole basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction over any part of the case is **diversity jurisdiction**. The basic purpose of 28 U.S.C. 1367(b) is to prevent the original plaintiff to a lawsuit from commencing a suit where initially there is complete diversity, but later on the plaintiff tries to bring in a non-diverse party by asserting a supplemental jurisdiction claim against that party, in a seeming effort to use supplemental jurisdiction to sneak past the complete diversity requirements of 28 U.S.C. 1332.

Under 28 U.S.C. 1367(c), **a federal court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction** over a claim if (1) the claim raises a **novel or complex issue of state law**; (2) the claim as to which there is only supplemental jurisdiction **substantially predominates** over those as to which there is freestanding subject matter jurisdiction; (3) the federal court has **dismissed** all claims with independent subject matter jurisdiction; or (4) other compelling reasons in exceptional circumstances.

## Personal Jurisdiction

In addition to subject matter jurisdiction over the case, a federal court must have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The three different types of personal jurisdiction a federal court can have are **general jurisdiction**; **in personam jurisdiction**; or **minimum contacts**.

For a federal court to have **general jurisdiction** over a person, the person must (1) be domiciled in the forum state or (2) assents to the case being heard in the forum state.

A federal court has **in personam jurisdiction** if the person is transient in the forum state and is notified.

A federal court can exercise specific general jurisdiction over a defendant that has **minimum contacts** with forum the state, meaning that the contacts with the forum state must have been (1) purposefully undertaken by the defendant; (2) such that it is foreseeable that he could be sued there; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

If the defendant is engaged in **e-commerce**, courts look at three factors to determine if the defendant’s product reached the forum state through e-commerce: (1) The level of interactivity on the defendant’s website; (2) The extent of “hits” on that website by users located in the forum state; and (3) The extent of commercial activity conducted by defendant in the forum state.
In determining whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is fair and reasonable courts consider (1) the burden on the defendant of having to litigate in the forum state; (2) the plaintiff’s interest in a convenient forum for obtaining relief; (3) the state’s interest in providing a forum; and (4) the interests of the interstate judicial system in efficiently resolving disputes.

**Long-Arm Statute**

A state long-arm statute often says that a state may exercise jurisdiction over absent defendants to the “full extent permitted by the due process clause of the United States Constitution.”

## Venue

When a federal court’s jurisdiction is based on diversity, venue is proper (1) in any district where a defendant resides if all defendants reside in the same state, or (2) in any district where a substantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to the action occurred, or (3) in any district where any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction, if there is no other district in which the action might be brought.

## The Erie Doctrine

The Erie Doctrine concerns whether a federal court should apply federal substantive law or state substantive law in a civil case. Substantive law is the part of law that creates, defines and regulates the rights, duties and powers of the parties.

In Erie, the Supreme Court ruled that in any civil case where there is no governing substantive federal statutory law or constitutional law, federal courts should apply state substantive law, regardless of whether it is state statutory law or state common law.

When a federal court sits in diversity jurisdiction and there is no controlling federal law, the federal court should apply the law of the state where the federal court sits, including the state’s choice of law rules, which could lead to the application of another state’s laws. Federal courts are generally required to apply substantive state law as the state’s highest court would rule.

## Procedural Law Post-Erie

In cases where there is no controlling substantive federal statutory law or constitutional law, federal courts must apply state substantive law and federal procedural law unless the federal procedural law is in substance, for that case, substantive. Procedural law consists of the rules that prescribe the steps for having a right or duty judicially enforced, as opposed to the law that defines the specific rights or duties themselves. In federal court, even in a case where state substantive law applies, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are the rules of procedure even to the displacement of any contrary state rules so long as the Federal Rule is consistent with the Constitution and the Rules Enabling Act. The Rules Enabling Act allows the Supreme Court to promulgate rules for civil practices in federal court so long as they don’t abridge,  enlarge, or modify any substantive right.

To determine the difference between procedural and substantive in a case where Erie mandates the application of state substantive law, if there is a conflict between a state rule and a codified Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rule controls so long as the Federal Rule is consistent with the Constitution and the Rules Enabling Act (it almost always is).

Where the competing federal rule is an uncodified judicial practice, Courts look to Erie, York, and sometimes Byrd to see whether the federal rule would hearken back to pre-Erie abuses (forum shopping and unequitable application of law). If it does, then it is “substantive,” and the state rule should apply under Erie—unless perhaps, as in Byrd, a significant federal-specific interest justifies applying the federal rule anyway.

## General Rules of Pleading

A complaint must have (1) grounds for subject-matter jurisdiction; (2) a statement of facts sufficient to show that the plaintiff is entitled to relief; and (3) a demand for judgment and the relief sought. Rule 8.

---

## Amendments

A party can amend a pleading once as a **matter of right**. A complaint can be amended within 21 days of serving the original complaint or within 21 days of being served an answer or a motion to dismiss. A party can amend an answer within 21 days of serving the original answer.

A party can amend a pleading with **permission** of the opposing party or permission of the court, which will consider the reason for delay and prejudice (usually granted).

---

## Amendments and Statue of Limitations

When **adding new claims**, the date of filing of an amendment will **relate back** to the original filing date if the new claim arises from the same transaction or occurrence as the existing claim (relation back rule).

When **adding new parties**, the date of filing will relate back to the original filing date if (1) the new claim arises from the same transaction and occurrence as the existing claim; (2) the new party knew of the suit soon enough not to be prejudiced (generally during the time permitted for service of the original complaint); and (3) the new party should have expected to be named, but-for a mistake in identity. [^2] [^3]

[^2]:EXAMPLE: P sued Astro Inc., a large multinational company, for breach of contract. Astro Inc. filed an answer truthfully denying that it had anything to do with the alleged contract. During discovery, P realized that her contract was not with Astro Inc., but with Astro Holdings LLC. Astro Holdings is a different legal entity but is managed by the same persons who manage Astro Inc. P now wishes to amend her complaint to add a claim against Astro Holdings (and dismiss her claim against Astro Inc.), but the statute of limitations has run. *P’s claim against Astro Holdings will probably be considered timely because Astro Holdings knew of her suit within the statute of limitations, knew it was the proper party, and was most likely not sued because of P’s mistake in identifying it as the proper party.*

[^3]:EXAMPLE: P sued Hospital for injuries she suffered in a surgery. Her doctor learned of the lawsuit when Hospital was served and was relieved not to be named as a defendant. During discovery and after the statute of limitations has run, she learns that Hospital is in horrible financial shape and will not be able to pay any judgment she obtains. She therefore seeks to amend her complaint to add the surgeon who performed the operation. *This amendment will not “relate back” because, although the surgeon knew of the lawsuit and may even have expected to be sued, P did not fail to sue the surgeon because of a mistaken identity. She simply made a conscious decision not to sue the surgeon. Put differently, her mistake was in litigation strategy, not in the identity of a would-be defendant.*

## Service of Process

When bringing a civil suit in federal court, a plaintiff must serve **both the complaint and the summons** within **90 days** of filing the complaint. If the plaintiff fails to serve the defendant within 90 days, the court must dismiss the suit without prejudice. However, if the plaintiff can show good cause, the court must provide the plaintiff additional time for service.

To serve process, a person must be at least 18 years old and not a party to the suit. Process can be served (1) in the manner prescribed by the state court in (a) the state where the federal suit was filed; or (b) the state where the defendant is currently located, even if it is not where the defendant resides or where the lawsuit is filed.

Process can be served (2) according to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that (a) if the defendant is a **natural person**, process can be (i) delivered to the defendant through a third party; (ii) left at the defendant’s usual abode with a person of suitable age and discretion residing there; (iii) delivered to the defendant’s registered agent; or (iv) mailed with a letter requesting the defendant waive in-person service (if the defendant declines to waive, they become responsible for the cost of personal service). If the defendant is a **corporation, partnership, or association**, process can be (i) delivered to an officer; (ii) delivered to to a managing agent or general agent; or (iii) delivered to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service. **If law requires service by mail, it must be by hand and mail.**

If a court has the power to assert personal jurisdiction over a party, that power becomes active at the moment the defendant is served with process or a waiver is filed with the court, if service is accomplished by request for waiver.

Where a plaintiff relies on transient jurisdiction (aka tag) to subject the defendant to personal jurisdiction, the court’s personal jurisdiction is created and activated when the plaintiff is served.

---

## Service and Due Process

The defendant is entitled to notice of the claims against them and an opportunity to respond to those claims. When a person is served, they have notice. To satisfy due process, service must be reasonably calculated to inform the defendant of the action against them.

*Notice without service may be a constitutional issue.*

To satisfy due process requirement for notice, the plaintiff must take steps that are reasonably calculated to inform the defendant of the action against them.

---

## Responding to a Complaint

**Answer**

A defendant's **answer** to a complaint is where the defendant admits or denies the plaintiff’s allegations and lists defenses. The defendant should specifically admit or deny each allegation. If an allegation is not denied, it is admitted. There is no limit to how many defenses a defendant can list. Common defenses are statute of limitations, statute of frauds, and assumption of risk. If a defense is not included in the answer, generally it is forfeited. However, there are some exceptions. Even if a defendant does not list them, the defendant does not forfeit defenses of (1) failure to state a claim upon which relief should be granted; (2) failure to join a necessary party; and (3) lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

**Motion for more definite statement:** Instead of filing an answer, a defendant can file a motion for more definite statement. The court will order a pleading to be clarified if it is so vague that the responding party cannot reasonably prepare a response.

**Motion to strike:** The court can (on its own or on motion) order material stricken if the complaint or answer contains redundant, immaterial, or scandalous material.

**Motion to dismiss:** Seeks dismissal, can be filed by any defending party.

## Timing of Responses

Initial response (answer or pre-answer motion):

If the defendant was actually served with process - **21 days** to respond.
If service of process was waived - **60 days** to respond.
If the defendant responds and motion for more definite statement, motion to strike, or motion to dismiss is **denied**, the defendant must file an answer within **14 days** of denial.

---

## Ethical Obligations

The submission of a document to the court must be based on **good faith**, **good facts**, and **good law**.

Safe harbor for 21 days after service to amend complaint.

Rule 11 does not apply to discovery.

---

## Provisional Relief

The plaintiff files suit seeking injunctive relief, but can’t litigate the suit fast enough to get that relief before the defendant commits some irreversible harm.

---

## Preliminary Injunction

There must be notice to the adverse party and the plaintiff must show (1) likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm to the plaintiff if preliminary injunction is not granted; (3) balance of hardships where if the harm to the plaintiff would be greater were the preliminary injunction denied than the harm to the defendant if it were granted; (4) the injunction would not be injurious to the public interest; and (5) payment of security where the plaintiff deposits enough money with the court to pay damages if the suit is unsuccessful.

---

## Temporary Restraining Order

Same test as preliminary injunction, but temporary restraining order expires 14 days after issuance. It can be extended for 14 days upon good cause shown.

A temporary restraining order can be **ex parte** (issued without notice) if (1) specific facts clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result before the adverse party can be heard in opposition; and (2) the movant’s attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.
