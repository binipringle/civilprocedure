## Subject Matter Jurisdiction

Subject-matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear a specific kind of claim. Federal courts have limited subject matter jurisdiction. They have subject matter jurisdiction if (1) the case is a federal question; or (2) there is complete diversity of citizenship between adverse parties and the amount in controversy is more than $75,000.

1.	Federal Question

Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over a case if the cause of action states that there has been a violation of federal law. The alleged violation of federal law has to be the reason why the case is being brought; it cannot be an additional charge if that charge does not go to the heart of the alleged offense.

2.	Diversity Jurisdiction

Federal courts can have subject matter jurisdiction if there is (a) complete diversity of citizenship between adverse parties and (b) the amount in controversy is more than $75,000. Complete diversity of citizenship is when all the adverse parties are citizens of different states.

**(a) Diversity of Citizenship**

A **person** is a citizen of a state where they have their domicile. A domicile is the place where a person lives and intends to continue living in the foreseeable future. Factors that contribute to showing that a state is a person’s domicile include whether that person resides in the state, owns property in the state, is licensed in the state, participates in political processes in the state (i.e., voting), pays taxes in the state, and is involved in community activities in the states.

A **corporation** is domiciled (1) where it was incorporated, and (2) where its principal place of business is located (where principal officers control corporate activities or the corporation has its “nerve center”).

**(b) Amount in Controversy**

The second requirement for a federal court to have diversity jurisdiction is that the amount in controversy be more than $75,000.

**(c) Venue**

When a federal court’s jurisdiction is based on diversity, venue is proper (1) in any district where a defendant resides if all defendants reside in the same state, or (2) in any district where a substantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to the action occurred, or (3) in any district where any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction, if there is no other district in which the action might be brought.

## Personal Jurisdiction

In addition to subject matter jurisdiction over the case, a federal court must have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The three different types of personal jurisdiction a federal court can have are **general jurisdiction**; **in personam jurisdiction**; or **minimum contacts**.

For a federal court to have **general jurisdiction** over a person, the person must (1) be domiciled in the forum state or (2) assents to the case being heard in the forum state.

A federal court has **in personam jurisdiction** if the person is transient in the forum state and is notified.

A federal court can exercise specific general jurisdiction over a defendant that has **minimum contacts** with forum the state, meaning that the contacts with the forum state must have been (1) purposefully undertaken by the defendant; (2) such that it is foreseeable that he could be sued there; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

If the defendant is engaged in **e-commerce**, courts look at three factors to determine if the defendant’s product reached the forum state through e-commerce: (1) The level of interactivity on the defendant’s website; (2) The extent of “hits” on that website by users located in the forum state; and (3) The extent of commercial activity conducted by defendant in the forum state.
In determining whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is fair and reasonable courts consider (1) the burden on the defendant of having to litigate in the forum state; (2) the plaintiff’s interest in a convenient forum for obtaining relief; (3) the state’s interest in providing a forum; and (4) the interests of the interstate judicial system in efficiently resolving disputes.

**Long-Arm Statute**

A state long-arm statute often says that a state may exercise jurisdiction over absent defendants to the “full extent permitted by the due process clause of the United States Constitution.”

## Supplemental Jurisdiction

Supplemental jurisdiction only exists in the situation where a lawsuit consists of more than one claim, and the federal court has valid jurisdiction (either diversity jurisdiction or federal question jurisdiction) over at least one of the claims. In that situation, if the federal claim and the other claims arise out of a "common nucleus of operative fact," then the court may (but does not have to) exercise supplemental jurisdiction to hear the other claims as well.

## The Erie Doctrine

The Erie Doctrine concerns whether a federal court should apply federal substantive law or state substantive law in a civil case. Substantive law is the part of law that creates, defines and regulates the rights, duties and powers of the parties.

In Erie, the Supreme Court ruled that in any civil case where there is no governing substantive federal statutory law or constitutional law, federal courts should apply state substantive law, regardless of whether it is state statutory law or state common law.

When a federal court sits in diversity jurisdiction and there is no controlling federal law, the federal court should apply the law of the state where the federal court sits, including the state’s choice of law rules, which could lead to the application of another state’s laws. Federal courts are generally required to apply substantive state law as the state’s highest court would rule.

## Procedural Law Post-Erie

In cases where there is no controlling substantive federal statutory law or constitutional law, federal courts must apply state substantive law and federal procedural law unless the federal procedural law is in substance, for that case, substantive. Procedural law consists of the rules that prescribe the steps for having a right or duty judicially enforced, as opposed to the law that defines the specific rights or duties themselves. In federal court, even in a case where state substantive law applies, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are the rules of procedure even to the displacement of any contrary state rules so long as the Federal Rule is consistent with the Constitution and the Rules Enabling Act. The Rules Enabling Act allows the Supreme Court to promulgate rules for civil practices in federal court so long as they don’t abridge,  enlarge, or modify any substantive right.

To determine the difference between procedural and substantive in a case where Erie mandates the application of state substantive law, if there is a conflict between a state rule and a codified Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rule controls so long as the Federal Rule is consistent with the Constitution and the Rules Enabling Act (it almost always is).

Where the competing federal rule is an uncodified judicial practice, Courts look to Erie, York, and sometimes Byrd to see whether the federal rule would hearken back to pre-Erie abuses (forum shopping and unequitable application of law). If it does, then it is “substantive,” and the state rule should apply under Erie—unless perhaps, as in Byrd, a significant federal-specific interest justifies applying the federal rule anyway.

## General Rules of Pleading

A complaint must have (1) grounds for subject-matter jurisdiction; (2) a statement of facts sufficient to show that the plaintiff is entitled to relief; and (3) a demand for judgment and the relief sought. Rule 8.

---

## Amendments

A party can amend a pleading once as a **matter of right**. A complaint can be amended within 21 days of serving the original complaint or within 21 days of being served an answer or a motion to dismiss. A party can amend an answer within 21 days of serving the original answer.

A party can amend a pleading with **permission** of the opposing party or permission of the court, which will consider the reason for delay and prejudice (usually granted).

## Amendments and Statue of Limitations

When **adding new claims**, the date of filing of an amendment will **relate back** to the original filing date if the new claim arises from the same transaction or occurrence as the existing claim (relation back rule).

When **adding new parties**, the date of filing will relate back to the original filing date if (1) the new claim arises from the same transaction and occurrence as the existing claim; (2) the new party knew of the suit soon enough not to be prejudiced (generally during the time permitted for service of the original complaint); and (3) the new party should have expected to be named, but-for a mistake in identity. [^1] [^2]

[^1]:EXAMPLE: P sued Astro Inc., a large multinational company, for breach of contract. Astro Inc. filed an answer truthfully denying that it had anything to do with the alleged contract. During discovery, P realized that her contract was not with Astro Inc., but with Astro Holdings LLC. Astro Holdings is a different legal entity but is managed by the same persons who manage Astro Inc. P now wishes to amend her complaint to add a claim against Astro Holdings (and dismiss her claim against Astro Inc.), but the statute of limitations has run. *P’s claim against Astro Holdings will probably be considered timely because Astro Holdings knew of her suit within the statute of limitations, knew it was the proper party, and was most likely not sued because of P’s mistake in identifying it as the proper party.*

[^2]:EXAMPLE: P sued Hospital for injuries she suffered in a surgery. Her doctor learned of the lawsuit when Hospital was served and was relieved not to be named as a defendant. During discovery and after the statute of limitations has run, she learns that Hospital is in horrible financial shape and will not be able to pay any judgment she obtains. She therefore seeks to amend her complaint to add the surgeon who performed the operation. *This amendment will not “relate back” because, although the surgeon knew of the lawsuit and may even have expected to be sued, P did not fail to sue the surgeon because of a mistaken identity. She simply made a conscious decision not to sue the surgeon. Put differently, her mistake was in litigation strategy, not in the identity of a would-be defendant.*

## Service of Process

When bringing a civil suit in federal court, a plaintiff must serve **both the complaint and the summons** within **90 days** of filing the complaint. If the plaintiff fails to serve the defendant within 90 days, the court must dismiss the suit without prejudice. However, if the plaintiff can show good cause, the court must provide the plaintiff additional time for service.

To serve process, a person must be at least 18 years old and not a party to the suit. Process can be served (1) in the manner prescribed by the state court in (a) the state where the federal suit was filed; or (b) the state where the defendant is currently located, even if it is not where the defendant resides or where the lawsuit is filed.

Process can be served (2) according to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that (a) if the defendant is a **natural person**, process can be (i) delivered to the defendant through a third party; (ii) left at the defendant’s usual abode with a person of suitable age and discretion residing there; (iii) delivered to the defendant’s registered agent; or (iv) mailed with a letter requesting the defendant waive in-person service (if the defendant declines to waive, they become responsible for the cost of personal service). If the defendant is a **corporation, partnership, or association**, process can be (i) delivered to an officer; (ii) delivered to to a managing agent or general agent; or (iii) delivered to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service. **If law requires service by mail, it must be by hand and mail.**

If a court has the power to assert personal jurisdiction over a party, that power becomes active at the moment the defendant is served with process or a waiver is filed with the court, if service is accomplished by request for waiver.

Where a plaintiff relies on transient jurisdiction (aka tag) to subject the defendant to personal jurisdiction, the court’s personal jurisdiction is created and activated when the plaintiff is served.

## Service and Due Process

The defendant is entitled to notice of the claims against them and an opportunity to respond to those claims. When a person is served, they have notice. To satisfy due process, service must be reasonably calculated to inform the defendant of the action against them.

*Notice without service may be a constitutional issue.*

To satisfy due process requirement for notice, the plaintiff must take steps that are reasonably calculated to inform the defendant of the action against them.

## Answer

A defendant's **answer** to a complaint is where the defendant admits or denies the plaintiff’s allegations and lists defenses. The defendant should specifically admit or deny each allegation. If an allegation is not denied, it is admitted. There is no limit to how many defenses a defendant can list. Common defenses are statute of limitations, statute of frauds, and assumption of risk. If a defense is not included in the answer, generally it is forfeited.

However, there are some exceptions. Even if a defendant does not list them, the defendant does not forfeit defenses of (1) failure to state a claim upon which relief should be granted; (2) failure to join a necessary party; and (3) lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Instead of filing an answer, a defendant can file a **motion for more definite statement**. The court will order a pleading to be clarified if it is so vague that the responding party cannot reasonably prepare a response.
