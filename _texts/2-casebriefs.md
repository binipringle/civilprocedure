## Pennoyer v. Neff, U.S. Supreme Court, 1877

**Issue:** Whether a state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident on the basis of property ownership alone.
Parties: Marcus Neff (plaintiff) (non-resident of Oregon), Sylvester Pennoyer (defendant)

**I. Uncontested facts:** Neff hired J.H Mitchell for legal work but did not pay Mitchell for his work. Mitchell sued in Oregon state court. Neff was not a resident of the state nor personally served with process (Mitchell published notice of the summons in Oregon). Neff failed to appear in court. The state court entered default judgment against Neff. Shortly thereafter, Neff took title to a tract of land in Oregon. Mitchell had the sheriff seize the land to be sold to satisfy the judgment. Mitchell bought the land at auction and assigned it to Pennoyer. Neff sued Pennoyer (defendant) to recover the property in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Oregon. The lower court concluded that Mitchell’s judgment was invalid due to defects in the affidavit on which the constructive service was based. Pennoyer appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

**II. Plaintiff Neff’s factual allegations:** Neff alleges that he was not under state jurisdiction of Oregon where he did not reside in Oregon and had no property in Oregon (Neff resided in California).

**III. Defendant Pennoyer’s factual allegations:** Pennoyer argues that he bought the property from Mitchell and therefore owns the property.

**IV. Lower court’s resolution of the fact:** The lower court held that the judgment against Neff was void because Neff did not reside in the state and had no property in the state, wherefore the state court had no jurisdiction over Neff when it made the judgment by which Neff had to pay Mitchell. The lower court held that the jurisdiction of the court cannot be made to depend upon facts to be ascertained after it has tried the cause and rendered the judgment. If the judgment be previously void, it will not become valid by the subsequent discovery of property of the defendant, or by his subsequent acquisition of it. [ … ] The contrary is the law: the validity of every judgment depends upon the jurisdiction of the court before it is rendered, not upon what may occur subsequently.
Procedural History: Mitchell sued Neff; default judgment against Neff; Mitchell executed judgement and seized Neff’s land, then transferred land to Pennoyer; Neff sued Pennoyer; appellate court ruled in Neff’s favor; Pennoyer appealed, and here we are.

**Court’s Reasoning:** [The plaintiff asserts] that the judgment in the State court against the plaintiff was void for want of personal service of process on him, or of his appearance in the action in which it was rendered, and that the premises in controversy could not be subjected to the payment of the demand [722] of a resident creditor except by a proceeding in rem; that is, by a direct proceeding against the property for that purpose. [This assertion is sound based on two principles.] One of these principles is, that every State possesses exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory. [ … ] The other principle of public law referred to follows from the one mentioned; that is, that no State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over persons or property without its territory. [ … ] [723] So the State, through its tribunals, may subject property situated within its limits owned by non-residents to the payment of the demand of its own citizens against them; and the exercise of this jurisdiction in no respect infringes upon the sovereignty of the State where the owners are domiciled. [ … ] If the non-resident [724] have no property in the State, there is nothing upon which the tribunals can adjudicate.

**Rule:** Under the Due Process Clause, no person is subject to the jurisdiction of a court unless she voluntarily appears in the court, is found within the state, resides in the state, or has property in the state that the court has attached.
