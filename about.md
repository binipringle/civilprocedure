The notes and outline on this site are based on Civil Procedure taught by Annie Seifullah at <a href="https://www.law.cuny.edu/">CUNY School of Law</a> in the summer of 2021. I chose to keep my notes and create my outline on a static site so that I can write mostly in plain text (I have to add HTML to Markdown when I want to nest), and have a lot of control over how I organize my work. This site is developed and maintained following <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing principles</a> for legibility, durability, ease and flexibility.</p>
