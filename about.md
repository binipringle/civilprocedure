The notes and outline on this site are based on Civil Procedure taught by Annie Seifullah at <a href="https://www.law.cuny.edu/">CUNY School of Law</a> in the summer of 2021. I created my outline on a static site in order to have a lot of control over how I organize my work. This site is developed and maintained following <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing principles</a> for legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. The Jekyll theme I used to build this site is <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/ed/">Ed.</a> distributed under an MIT license, software copyright (C) 2016â€“present Alex Gil, Karl Stolley, and contributors.
